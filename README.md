# PywinautoLibrary for Robot Framework

This is a custom Robot Framework library for automating Windows GUI applications using the **Pywinauto** library. 
It enables users to control and interact with desktop applications on Windows through Robot Framework test cases.

## What is Pywinauto?

**Pywinauto** is a Python package that allows you to automate and interact with GUI applications running on Windows. 
It supports actions like mouse clicks, keyboard input, and window manipulation, making it an excellent choice for testing Windows desktop applications. 
Pywinauto works by simulating user interactions with the application's controls, making it ideal for automating repetitive tasks and GUI testing.
Pywinauto supports both native Windows GUI controls (via the `win32` backend) and modern UI elements (via the `uia` backend).
